        <p> At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document <br/>
            (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? <br/> Three columns of content? 
             A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts 
             and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

	<p>  
		Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, 
                and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. 
                Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
